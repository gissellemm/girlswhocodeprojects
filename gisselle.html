      <p class="bio">Hello! I am a girl who codes from Atlanta, Ga. I am currently enrolled in the
         AT&T Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program where I am learning how to code
         using the Python language. I am also a rising senior at Cross Keys High School.
         I look forward to applying to colleges and learning new things. My family consists
         of  my parents, 3 siblings, and the cutest dog in the world, Bella. I enjoy the outdoors,
         listening to music, and watching foreign TV shows. </p>
